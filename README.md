Step 1:

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Allow Only Pull Requests to Main

Go to your repo on GitHubüëâ https://github.com/cloudninja365/just-for-testing
Click on the Settings tab.
In the left sidebar, click Branches.
Under Branch protection rules, click "Add rule".
In Branch name pattern, type:
Check the following boxes:
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require approvals (optional, but recommended)
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass (optional, if you have CI/CD)
‚úÖ Include administrators (if you want to enforce this on repo admins too)
‚ùå Leave "Allow force pushes" and "Allow deletions" unchecked
Click Create at the bottom.
---

üîí What This Does:

Prevents direct pushes to main
Forces all changes to come through pull requests
Adds code review and CI enforcement if desired
---
Let me know if you want help setting this up for multiple branches or need help enforcing PR reviews.
